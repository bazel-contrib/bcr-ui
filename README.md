# Bazel Central Registry Web UI

This repository provides a web UI for the [Bazel Central Registry (BCR)](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry).
It entirely consists of statically rendered pages, which are updated as soon as a new commit is pushed to the BCR.

## Contributing

We are happy about any contributions!

To get started you can take a look at our [Github issues](https://github.com/hobofan/bcr-web-ui/issues).

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
license, shall be licensed as below, without any additional terms or
conditions.

### Getting Started

We use git submodules to include the data from bazelbuild/bazel-central-registry, so after cloning this repo you need to run:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

To get a buildozer binary, you also need to run this before launching the app:

```bash
./build_bins.sh
```

Packages are managed via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), so they can be installed via `npx pnpm install`

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000/bazel-central-registry> with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Learn More about Next.js

The page is built on top of Next.js.
