executable¯Whether source tree files written should be made executable.

This applies to all source tree files written by this target. This attribute is not propagated to `additional_update_targets`.

write_source_file#//lib/private:write_source_file.bzl*Âwrite_source_files provides a workaround for the restriction that `bazel build` cannot write to the source tree.

Read more about the philosophy of writing to the source tree: <https://blog.aspect.build/bazel-can-write-to-the-source-folder>

## Usage

```starlark
load("@bazel_lib//lib:write_source_files.bzl", "write_source_files")

write_source_files(
    name = "write_foobar",
    files = {
        "foobar.json": "//some/generated:file",
    },
)
```

To update the source file, run:

```bash
bazel run //:write_foobar
```

The generated `diff_test` will fail if the file is out of date and print out instructions on
how to update it.

If the file does not exist, Bazel will fail at analysis time and print out instructions on
how to create it.

You can declare a tree of generated source file targets:

```starlark
load("@bazel_lib//lib:write_source_files.bzl", "write_source_files")

write_source_files(
    name = "write_all",
    additional_update_targets = [
        # Other write_source_files targets to run when this target is run
        "//a/b/c:write_foo",
        "//a/b:write_bar",
    ]
)
```

And update them with a single run:

```bash
bazel run //:write_all
```

When a file is out of date, you can leave a suggestion to run a target further up in the tree by specifying `suggested_update_target`.
For example,

```starlark
write_source_files(
    name = "write_foo",
    files = {
        "foo.json": ":generated-foo",
    },
    suggested_update_target = "//:write_all"
)
```

A test failure from `foo.json` being out of date will yield the following message:

```
//a/b:c:foo.json is out of date. To update this and other generated files, run:

    bazel run //:write_all

To update *only* this file, run:

    bazel run //a/b/c:write_foo
```

You can also add a more customized error message using the `diff_test_failure_message` argument:

```starlark
write_source_file(
    name = "write_foo",
    out_file = "foo.json",
    in_file = ":generated-foo",
    diff_test_failure_message = "Failed to build Foo; please run {{TARGET}} to update."
)
```

A test failure from `foo.json` being out of date will then yield:

```
Failed to build Foo; please run //a/b/c:write_foo to update.
```

If you have many `write_source_files` targets that you want to update as a group, we recommend wrapping
`write_source_files` in a macro that defaults `suggested_update_target` to the umbrella update target.

NOTE: If you run formatters or linters on your codebase, it is advised that you exclude/ignore the outputs of this
    rule from those formatters/linters so as to avoid causing collisions and failing tests.2//lib:write_source_files.bzl
